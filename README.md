# adyen-mock-terminal-api
Adyen Mock Terminal API is a mock server that handles requests and responses from a POS device. 
Developers can use this to test their application quickly without having a physical POS device. 
Note that this application is not able to reject all invalid requests.

Currently, the Mock terminal is used to support our In-Person Payments Integration Examples on github/adyen-examples.
